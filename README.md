# matplotlib-challenge

I struggled with this one, I followed a lot of the code from the week 4 and 5 activities, and the matplotlib documentation.

The section before the boxplot about the tumor volume at the max point for 4 different drug treatment took me a while to figure out, I referenced some of the code on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamiedataviz/module-5-matplotlib

For the scatter plot and the regression line I reviewed these websites: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matplotlib/matplotlib_annotations.htm, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matplotlib-pyplot-annotate-in-python/
